# Introduction

There were several things I wanted to write about off the night. It didn't happen, but wishfully I would have some more time

# Impressions

My memory has capability at most equivalent to a potato.
Some fragment might just be fabricated, on fascinated something ever happened, don't get offended. Or it might just a few reason I wanted to stroke my keyboard, enjoying the tactile feeling from the blue switches.

## The Room

First off that Katy Perry song was "Double Rainbow", the feminist herself definitely didn't claim trash on her value,how am I kidding.

I were asked about the room, compared against Vava's room.
Your room definitely have a distributed vibe of separation. It might be completely implicit or person specific(a.k.a just to me.).

If given every item a mouth, everyone would be shouting "notice me (senpai)". By no mean I remember anything, they are in a harmonic equilibrium, yet characterizing themselves.

The door-sided white frame mild-corn color picture(not really any idea on what those are)on the wall.

## Feelings

The complexions on your face used to be the type I scared of, God knows why I keep moving towards those women,a questionable. But growing up realizing much about, the power of fear is

I appreciate the consistent color-ed mail,the green 4 leafs grass wraps at the end. Not everyone do that, a organization.

# The Movie 10 Years

Apparently, the heated title of 2015 movie festival isn't a depiction of 2025 Hong Kong by means of environment, infrastructure.

From the trailer, hardly anything tabulates my future-list,

Certain concept were stated in the 2minute trailer, 2025:

- Aging population, adapt to retro living style, and not keen to change (folded Chinese cultural poster behind)
  - failed to have stable jobs.
  - consider a minority group,misunderstood by public

- Politics
  - are conspiracy(which is true, one way or another.)
  - untrustworthy activity

- Direction to Hong Kong
  - directed by Mainland China
  - people experienced gun violence.
  - homeland security law doesn't constraint citizen's behavior,

- Cantonese dialect considered
  - To discourage son speaking Cantonese, accuse husband using Cantonese, good parenting advice. (halirious, It could be intended.)
  - unlawful language, (right next to a out-of-focus TAXI's Cantonese Sign,in case you missed.)

- democracy
  - people think the deja vu exists,but yet achieved.
  - there are no way to stop the arson, if it is already too late.

- cultural representation
  - censorship

My takes on those topics

- Aging Populations
  -  It is not avoidable rapid machine automation lay off unskilled/educated fellas.
  - While big corporation are reluctant to hire 'human' labor,
    - they did the one-off payment.
  - The new young company
    - cannot afford automation.
    - insufficient human resource.  
  - So instead of giving 100% money support though those stupid funding schemes.
    - redirect those unemployed but willing to work.
      - try young-old collaborations,with guidance, peripherals education.
    - subsidences should offered both parties,to offer better efficiency.
    - It also alleviate the 'disconnected population'  
  - There were several other plans came across my mind throughout my life, might be naive, yet clearly not unsolvable.

- Politics, democracy, secretive cultural representation
  - I am not avid towards the Hong Kong thingy, nor a patriot, I do not deny.
  - Politics are/have to be conspiracy theories
    - It's a job specification of politicians worldwide:
      - dogfight against and cover scandals,waste your hard earned money, before actually getting anything done.
      - good at (correctly) present facts,aka fabricated facts.
  - democracy
    - I do agree on there's point of no return with regard to


- Cantonese dialect
  - deprecating a dialect in county with 100+ year history
    - Will be ATV gone in 10years?, how about TVB?.
      - That answers the question,it is not going to happen, not in 10 years.
  - The hierarchy of Hong Kong Police or other Justice Departments.
    - It would have be the population in their 20s, monitoring.




I am pretty sure those director have their anesthetic to convey their vision, yet how much would be right? Doubtful, said a ignorant 23 year old.

It some what reminds me of the Movie, I watched of late,
South Park: Bigger, Longer & Uncut(R rated,right from the title)
a (vulgar) discussion of media/movie vowel language,violence, and whatever reason they hate/love Canadians.

World is evolving to a stage censorship is a set of formalities, a trap to false sense of security.

it was already known and accepted on 1999 by those 'Muricunts on their favorite comedy show.

So what I do with Me,MySelf and I version of 10Years?

# Life

I don't think I mentioned that my chair broke, for fairly long time, and eventually the big chair. I never had a good chair.

# Works

I tried figuring stuff I imagine building, in a new way. I never really like publishing things as though I do not enjoy.

I read the Graphql thing from

It is surprisingly more difficult to model something that didn't exist.

# Progress on letters from the hospital.

The letter were out.

# The "Don't Flip"-message from a bottom of Milk bottom

My Letter used to be really long, in case you don't have time, there used to be some titles thats a lot more relevant than the others. But in my believe professional learned how to consume their food, however disgusting.

We all are con-sum-ers, constantly summing things, from politics to poverty, fashion to food. The one, who managed to reduce the right thing takes the cake.

Jimmy.
